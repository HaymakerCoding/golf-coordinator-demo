    <h1>Thank you for testing out our demo app!</h1>

    <p>This demos some business functions for running a golf event. It's purpose is to show case my knowledge of building a complete modern web application. 
        From database design and implentation, to server API routes with JWT token authentication and elegant client side user interface. While not meant to be a perfect application this is simply a demo of coding skills and web development.
        I can build similar web applications to suite different buisness needs than golfing, as well as build such apps with different frameworks, languages, database systems and tools.
